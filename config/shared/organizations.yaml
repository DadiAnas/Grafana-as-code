# ORGANIZATIONS — Shared across all environments
# =============================================================================
# Grafana supports multi-tenancy via Organizations. Each org is an isolated
# workspace with its own dashboards, datasources, teams, and users.
#
# "Main Organization" (id: 1) exists by default in every Grafana instance.
# Add more organizations below if you need multi-tenant separation.
