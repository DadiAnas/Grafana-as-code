# FOLDER PERMISSIONS — Shared across all environments
# =============================================================================
# Folders are auto-discovered from the dashboards/ directory structure:
#   dashboards/shared/<org_name>/<folder_uid>/
#   dashboards/<env>/<org_name>/<folder_uid>/
#
# This file is used ONLY for:
#   1. Setting folder display name overrides (name)
#   2. Defining granular permissions per folder
#
# If a folder is not listed here, it gets default permissions (org-level).
# =============================================================================

folders: []
  # --- Example: Override folder name and add permissions ---
  # - name: "Infrastructure Monitoring"    # Display name in Grafana
  #   uid: "infrastructure"                 # Must match the directory name
  #   permissions:
  #     - team: "SRE Team"
  #       permission: "Admin"              # Admin | Edit | View
  #     - team: "Backend Team"
  #       permission: "Edit"
  #     - role: "Viewer"                   # Built-in role: Viewer | Editor | Admin
  #       permission: "View"
  #
  # - name: "Application Dashboards"
  #   uid: "applications"
  #   permissions:
  #     - role: "Editor"
  #       permission: "Edit"
  #     - role: "Viewer"
  #       permission: "View"
  #
  # --- Example: Folder with no explicit permissions (inherits defaults) ---
  # - name: "Public Status"
  #   uid: "public-status"
