# TEAMS — Shared across all environments
# =============================================================================
# Teams are organization-scoped groups of users. Each team must specify
# which organization it belongs to via the "org" field.
#
# Teams can be assigned folder permissions (see folders.yaml).
# Teams can only access folders within the SAME organization.
