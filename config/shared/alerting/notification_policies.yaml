# =============================================================================
# NOTIFICATION POLICIES — Shared across all environments
# =============================================================================
# Defines how alerts are routed to contact points.
# Uses Grafana's native notification policy format.
# Environment-specific overrides go in config/<env>/alerting/notification_policies.yaml.
#
# Each policy is per-organization and specifies:
#   - receiver: default contact point
#   - group_by: labels to group alerts by
#   - routes: child policies with label matchers
# =============================================================================

policies: []
  # --- Example: Basic notification policy ---
  # - org: "Main Organization"
  #   receiver: "email-alerts"             # Default contact point name
  #   group_by:
  #     - "alertname"
  #     - "namespace"
  #   group_wait: "30s"                    # Wait before sending first notification
  #   group_interval: "5m"                 # Interval between grouped notifications
  #   repeat_interval: "4h"               # Resend interval for firing alerts
  #   routes:
  #     # Route critical alerts to PagerDuty
  #     - receiver: "pagerduty-critical"
  #       object_matchers:
  #         - ["severity", "=", "critical"]
  #       continue: false
  #       group_wait: "10s"
  #
  #     # Route warnings to Slack
  #     - receiver: "slack-notifications"
  #       object_matchers:
  #         - ["severity", "=", "warning"]
  #       continue: true
  #       group_wait: "1m"
