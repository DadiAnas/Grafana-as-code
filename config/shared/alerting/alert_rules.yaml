# =============================================================================
# ALERT RULES — Shared across all environments
# =============================================================================
# Uses Grafana's native alert rule group format.
# Environment-specific overrides go in config/<env>/alerting/alert_rules.yaml.
#
# Each group must specify:
#   - folder: the folder UID where alerts are stored
#   - name: rule group name
#   - interval: evaluation interval (e.g., "1m", "5m")
#   - org / orgId: which organization this alert belongs to
#   - rules: list of alert rules with queries and conditions
# =============================================================================

groups: []
  # --- Example: Alert rule group ---
  # - folder: "alerts"                    # Must match folder UID (directory name)
  #   name: "High CPU Usage"
  #   interval: "1m"
  #   org: "Main Organization"            # Or use orgId: 1
  #   rules:
  #     - title: "CPU Usage Critical"
  #       condition: "C"                  # Ref ID of the condition expression
  #       for: "5m"                       # Duration before alert fires
